## [About][About]
I love the *i3vm* and I love the ease of use it brings using just a keyboard, but it doesn't have many features that interact with the *Spotify* experience, whether it be in terms of notifications or the need to pick up the mouse to change tracks and pause and resume the currently playing tracks.

**Spoi3fy** is a simple collection of my settings that make the experience of using the best music player with the best window manager much better.

### Features

 - Show track title running on *Spotify*  in *i3* status bar.  
 - Pause, resume and change tracks with keyboard with a *VIM* editor lover.

Clone repository to your prefered location.

Move the scripts directory to your *i3* config file (usually placed in `~/.config/i3/`).

Insert the contents of the config file at the end of your config file, path `~/.config/i3/config`.

Still in `~/.config/i3/config` add the following line to the `bar` field.

    bar {
    	status_command i3blocks -c ~/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf 
    }

Insert the contents of the `i3blocks.conf` file in your *i3blocks* configuration file, path `~/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf`.

Restart your *i3vm* environment (usually `Mod + Shift + R`).
