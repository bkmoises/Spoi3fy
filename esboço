About
I love the i3vm and I love the ease of use it brings using just a keyboard, but it doesn't have many features that interact with the spotify experience, whether it be in terms of notifications or the need to pick up the mouse to change tracks and pause and resume the currently playing tracks.

Spoi3fy is a simple collection of my settings that make the experience of using the best music player with the best window manager much better.

Features
Show track title running on spotify in i3 status bar.
Pause, resume and change tracks with keyboard with a VIM editor lover.
